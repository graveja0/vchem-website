## Introduction: All Paired Up

Model causal inference theory is based on the idea of potential outcomes. The potential outcome framework is a way of thinking about causality that allows us to formalize the idea of a causal effect. In this framework, we assume that each unit has two potential outcomes: one that would be observed if the unit is treated, and one that would be observed if the unit is not treated. The causal effect of the treatment is the difference between these two potential outcomes.

<!-- Imagine you're at a dance, observing the dancers gliding across the floor. Each pair moves to the rhythm in their unique style—some sway gently, others twist and turn with flamboyance. Now, what if I told you that in the world of data, there's a magical concept that helps us understand how two variables move together, just like our dance partners? This is where the copula steps in. -->

<!-- Think of a copula as the choreographer of the statistical dance floor. It doesn't care about the dancers' individual moves (their specific values). Instead, it's all about the connection, the synchrony, how one dancer's spin might be linked to their partner's dip. In causal inference, a copula helps us isolate and understand this very dance—the relationship—without getting bogged down by the solo performances. It's not about the steps; it's about the togetherness, the pattern of partnership. And just like in dance, understanding these patterns can tell us a story far beyond what meets the eye, letting us predict the next move in the grand dance of variables. -->

<!-- Copulas are statistical tools used to describe the dependence between random variables. The intuition behind copulas is to separate the dependence structure from the marginal distributions of a multivariate distribution. In simpler terms, they allow us to study the relationship between variables independently of their individual behaviors. By using copulas, we can model the correlation between different variables while ignoring the specifics about how each of these variables behaves on its own. It's like trying to understand the relationship between two people while disregarding their individual characteristics or personalities. This makes copulas extremely useful in fields like finance, where understanding the correlation between different assets is often more important than understanding the properties of each individual asset. -->

<!-- The intuition behind copulas is to separate the dependence structure between random variables from their marginal distributions. A copula captures the correlation or dependency between several random variables, regardless of their individual properties or distributions. By doing this, it allows us to study the interdependencies between these variables separately from their marginal behaviors. Basically, a copula is a function that links multiple univariate distributions to form a multivariate distribution. This concept is crucial in quantifying the degree to which the random variables are related to one other, which has important applications in fields like finance, insurance, and risk management, among others. -->
