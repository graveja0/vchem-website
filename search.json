fundamental matrix gives you expected occupancy without any cycle correction. So it’s not great for plugging in endogenous life table values; you’d really want to just solve for life expectancy using rewards and use those values.\n\nSee 1. vs. 2 for this (with no discounting, no sickness transitions, and a reasonably high background death transition)\n\nOnce you add the reward matrices (3 vs. 4) you essentially get the same answer whether or not you use the cycle correction. This is because the cycle correction is just a way of accounting for the fact that transitions don’t happen at the beginning or end of each cycle. But the reward matrix approach is already accounting for that. So you don’t need to do both.\nWe can also use basic math and an exponential death rate to get the same answer as above (see 3. vs. 4 vs. 5)\n6 and 7 use partial rewards and are similar to the above. Markov trace with half-cycle correction, and reward matrix, both yield nearly identical answers.\n8 vs. 9 shows that transition rewards (for YLLs) are also hte same using a markov trace diff(deaths) approach and the matrix with rewards approach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nCaswell, Hal, and Silke van Daalen. 2021. “Healthy Longevity from Incidence-Based Models: More Kinds of Health Than Stars in the Sky.” Demographic Research 45 (July): 397–452. https://doi.org/10.4054/demres.2021.45.13.\n\n\nCaswell, Hal, and Virginia Zarulli. 2018. “Matrix Methods in Health Demography: A New Approach to the Stochastic Analysis of Healthy Longevity and DALYs.” Population Health Metrics 16 (1). https://doi.org/10.1186/s12963-018-0165-5."

    "text": "What is the Expected Value of Sample Information?\nTo build an intuitive foundation for what follows, suppose we decide to design a randomized experiment that will improve our knowledge of MVPF parameter(s) \\(\\pi_z\\).33 Note that all other remaining MVPF parameters in \\(\\mathbf{\\pi}\\) are captured in \\(\\mathbf{\\pi_{-z}}\\), such that \\(\\mathbf{\\pi} = (\\mathbf{\\pi_{z}},\\mathbf{\\pi_{-z}})\\).\nWe traditionally think about the design of randomized experiments in terms of their statistical power—that is, the probability that a statistical test will detect a difference between treated and untreated groups, when such a difference exists.\nAnother way to state the above is that we want to avoid Type II error. But there are often practical (often resource-based) limits to how far we are willing to go on this.\nOne way to minimize Type II error is simply to enroll thousands or even millions of study units (e.g., people, households, clinics, etc.). But while that would yield a trial with power at or near 100%, our trial would be costly, time-consuming, and resource intensive—and we may well incur an additional loss in social welfare if an efficacious policy is (randomly) withheld from a large fraction of the overall population.\nConsequently, it is common to think of trial design in terms of enrolling enough study units so that a comparison of outcomes between treated and treated units has least 80% power to detect an effect. There is a vast statistical literature specifying analytic formulas and simulation-based exercises to optimize this (statistical) dimension of experimental design.\nA useful way to think about the EVSI is as the social welfare analog to power. That is, we want to avoid implementing a policy that results in a sub-optimal level of social welfare. It may be that doing nothing (or implementing some alternative policy option) would be the welfare-optimizing choice–but the available (uncertain) evidence leads us down the wrong decision path. To avoid this, we can leverage the EVSI to guide our study design so that we can optimize societal payoff of both the research itself, and the resulting policy decision.\nFrom a design perspective, the EVPPI for our parameter(s) of interest (\\(\\pi_z\\)) provides an upper bound on the information value that would accrue from obtaining perfect information on the “true” value(s) of \\(\\pi_z\\). In that sense, designing a trial that enrolls enough people or units to obtain an EVSI that is very close to the EVPPI is like designing a trial with statistical power at or near 100%.\nBy the same token, we can also think about designing a smaller-scale experiment that provides some new information value, but not (near) perfect information. But just as we want to avoid an under-powered trial, we also want to avoid a situation where the information value we obtain from our study is not enough to inform the policymaker’s decision.\nCalculating the EVSI for different trial sizes (and designs) allows us to do just this."

    "text": "Expected Value of Perfect Information\nOur first guidepost is to make sure that any future research would help inform our policymaker’s decision.6 To assess this, we estimate the EVPI for various societal willingness-to-pay parameter (\\(\\lambda\\)) values. Figure 1 summarizes this exercise.6 We covered the EVPI in detail in part one of this series, however both the formulas and code are provided here for the example at hand.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEVPI Equations and Notation (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nPolicy benefits are summarized by \\(W(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)\\), and costs by \\(C(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)\\). The vector \\(\\mathbf{\\pi}\\) captures welfare-relevant parameters such as the average willingness-to-pay for the policy, program costs, and any fiscal externalities (FEs) that occur as a consequence of the policy.\nWe define and measure welfare benefits and costs for each of \\(D\\) total policy strategies \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = (\\alpha_1, \\cdots , \\alpha_D)\\).\nFinally, \\(\\lambda\\) summarizes societal willigness-to-pay (WTP), i.e., a policy with MVPF greater than or equal to \\(\\lambda\\) passes a societal cost-benefit test. This threshold value could simply be based on an MVPF of one (i.e., the benefit must be at least as great as the cost). Or, if society values some redistribution, \\(\\lambda\\) could be set based on a value less than one.\nThe net welfare benefit (NWB) is defined as:\n\\[\nNWB(\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\alpha,\\lambda) = W(\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\alpha) - \\lambda \\cdot C(\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\alpha)\n\\tag{1}\\]\nand we define the optimal strategy as\n\\[\n\\alpha^* =\\arg\\max E_{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} \\big [ NWB(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\lambda) \\big ]\n\\]\nwhere \\(E_{\\pi}\\) is the expectation over the joint uncertainty distribution of current knowledge. Thus, \\(NWB(\\alpha^*,\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\lambda)\\) captures the net welfare benefit evaluated at the optimal strategy.\nThe Expected Value of Perfect Information (EVPI) is given by:\n\\[\nEVPI(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\lambda) = E_{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}} \\big [ \\max_{\\boldsymbol{\\alpha}} NWB(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\lambda) \\big ] - NWB(\\alpha^*,\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\lambda)\n\\tag{2}\\]\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\ncalc_nwb &lt;- function(B,C,lambda) {\n    B - lambda * C\n}\n\ncalc_evpi &lt;- function(B,      # Benefits\n                      C,      # Net Costs\n                      lambda  # Societal willingness-to-pay \n                     ) {\n    nwb_ &lt;- calc_nwb(B = B, C = C, lambda = lambda)\n    evpi &lt;- mean(pmax(0,nwb_))-max(0,mean(nwb_)) \n    return(tibble(lambda = lambda, evpi = evpi))\n}\n\nevpi_data &lt;- \n    lambdas %&gt;% \n    map_df(~(calc_evpi(B = delta_W, C = (delta_E - delta_C), lambda = .x)))\n\nxlab &lt;- expression(paste(\"MVPF Value of Societal Willingness-to-Pay (\",lambda,\")\"))\n  \np &lt;- \n    evpi_data %&gt;% \n    ggplot(aes(x = lambda, y = evpi)) + \n    geom_point(size = 4) + geom_line(linewidth=1.25) + \n    theme_hc() + \n    theme(text = element_text(family = 'Arial')) +\n    labs(x = xlab, y = \"Value of Information\\nEVPI\")\n    #labs(x = \"Societal WTP Value (lambda)\", y = \"Value of Information (EVPI, EVPPI)\")\np\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Expected Value of Perfect Information by Societal Willingness to Pay Value\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1 shows that there is overall value in reducing information uncertainty in the policy decision—and this information value is maximized near a \\(\\lambda\\) value of 0.85.77 To provide some context for this value, Hendren (2016) estimates that the the MVPF for the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—a popular means-tested cash transfer program—is around 0.9. It is worth noting, however, that later updates center the EITC MVPF estimate at 1.12."

    "text": "Introduction\nSuppose a policymaker is considering strategies to reduce poverty. For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume the policymaker is weighing the tradeoffs of creating or expanding an in-kind benefit transfer, such as a job training program.\nImplementing the program has a measurable impact on welfare-relevant outcomes (e.g., education, lifetime earnings, health, etc.). However, the program also imposes costs on society. These costs reflect both the budgetary cost (i.e., the total sum of program expenditures), as well as other changes in behavior, expenditures, or tax revenues that either bolster or drag on social welfare.\nBefore we proceed, it is useful to formalize the above and define summary measures of policy benefits \\(W(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)\\) and costs \\(C(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)\\). The vector \\(\\mathbf{\\pi}\\) captures welfare-relevant parameters such as the average willingness-to-pay for the policy, program costs, and any fiscal externalities (FEs) that occur as a consequence of the policy.1 We define and measure welfare benefits and costs for each of \\(D\\) total policy strategies \\(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha} = (\\alpha_1, \\cdots , \\alpha_D)\\).1 For example, these fiscal externalities might include changes to government tax revenues stemming from changes in participation in the labor force and/or other social programs.\nIn a series of influential papers, Hendren and colleagues define the Marginal Value of Public Funds (MVPF) as the ratio of benefits to costs (Finkelstein and Hendren 2020; Hendren and Sprung-Keyser 2022, 2022; Hendren 2016):\n\\[\nMVPF(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha) = \\frac{W(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)}{C(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThe MVPF measures the marginal value of an additional dollar spent on a policy. That is, the MVPF quantifies how the welfare benefits accrued by implementing a policy compare to the costs of adopting it.\nWhile we will leave the theoretical details to the aforementioned citations, we can summarize the MVPF of an in-kind benefit transfer as:\n\\[\nMVPF^{\\text{inkind}}(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha) = \\frac{W(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)}{1+FE(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)}\n\\tag{2}\\] where \\(FE(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)\\) is the fiscal externality associated with the policy, and \\(W(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)\\) is the willingness to pay among infra-marginal recipients of the program.\nIn this example, we are comparing a single policy strategy (in-kind benefit program) to an alternative strategy of doing nothing. However, in principle we could think of alternative (competing) strategies to achieve the same objective—each with its own welfare cost and benefit estimates—that might be under consideration."

    "text": "MVPF as a Decision Tool\nTable 1 highlights that the policymaker’s decision is fraught with uncertainty. Based on current information, the estimated MVPF of the in-kind benefit is 0.894. However, the 95% interval shows that current knowledge is consistent with the policy more than paying for itself (i.e., an MVPF above 1), and with the policy resulting in some redistribution (i.e., an MVPF below 1).\nIn short, based on current evidence, it is hard to say for sure whether the policy should be adopted.\nOur policymaker’s decision problem actually goes one step further. The MVPF summarizes the private benefits that accrue from the in-kind benefit transfer; it may be that social preferences are such that, from a societal perspective, a policy with an MVPF below 1.0 is not worth pursuing.\nWe can formalize this idea by defining an additional parameter \\(\\lambda\\) summarizing societal willigness-to-pay (WTP). This threshold value could simply be based on an MVPF of one (i.e., the benefit must be at least as great as the cost). Or, if society values some redistributive consequence of the policy, \\(\\lambda\\) could be set based on a value less than one.22 For example, Finkelstein, Hendren, and Shepard (2019) make comparative assessments of health insurance subsidization policies by specifying a social welfare function over Constant Relative Risk Aversion (CRRA) utility and a defined coefficient of risk aversion (\\(\\sigma = 3\\)). This results in \\(\\lambda = 0.2\\). But researchers do not necessarily have to specify the structure of the social welfare function to define a decision-making benchmark. A value tied to an existing policy with strong social support could also suffice. For instance, Finkelstein, Hendren, and Shepard (2017) also consider a benchmark (\\(\\lambda = 0.88\\)) based on the MVPF of the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)—a popular means-tested cash transfer program. Finally, Hendren (2020) argues for the use of efficient welfare weights that project the welfare costs and benefits of any specific policy into the MVPF of a tax transfer between the affected populations.\nFigure 1 visualizes this uncertainty for 1,000 draws from the uncertainty distributions of \\(W^{\\text{inkind}}(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)\\) and \\(C^{\\text{inkind}}(\\mathbf{\\pi},\\alpha)\\) in Table 1.3 In addition, for three hypothetical values of \\(\\lambda\\), each point is shaded based on whether the implied MVPF is above or below \\(\\lambda\\).3 For the sake of this example, welfare benefits are drawn from a lognormal distribution with mean \\(\\log(1.2)\\) and standard deviation \\(0.1\\). Welfare costs are based on Equation 2 and a fiscal externality that is normally distributed with mean \\(0.35\\) and standard deviation \\(0.2\\).\nThe dotted lines show a ray from the origin with slope \\(1/\\lambda\\); values that fall under and to the right of the line are those where the MVPF\\(\\geq \\lambda\\) and those that fall up and to the left of the line are those where MVPF\\(&lt;\\lambda\\). Finally, the green diamonds plot the average welfare benefit and cost values as summarized in Table 1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(a) lambda = 1.0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(b) lambda = 0.90\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n(c) lambda = 0.5\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Welfare Cost and Benefits Overlaid With Decision Rules Based on \\(\\lambda\\)\n\n\nFigure 1 (a) highlights that when \\(\\lambda=1\\), the MVPF of the in-kind benefit strategy rarely exceeds the societal willingness-to-pay threshold. In other words, there are few points in the joint uncertainty distribution where the value falls below and to the right of the dotted line. Thus, there is some—but not much—uncertainty in the decision to not implement the policy under this decision criterion.\nBy comparison, Figure 1 (c) shows that when \\(\\lambda=0.5\\), there is no decision uncertainty; our policymaker would conclude that the the in-kind benefit should be adopted—and this decision is consistent across all values in the uncertainty ranges."

    "text": "The Opportunity Cost of Imperfect Information\nThe above discussion highlights that depending on social preferences, policy decisions based on current information may carry an opportunity cost of making the wrong decision. This is most evident in Figure 1 (b), where based on the average welfare cost estimates in Table 1 (plotted as a green dot in Figure 1 (b)), the policymaker might elect to pursue an in-kind benefit program. In other words, the implied average MPVF basd on these values is 0.894. If \\(\\lambda = 0.9\\), this value is below the WTP threshold—so the policy would appear to pass a societal cost-benefit test.\nHowever, Figure 1 (b) also makes clear the available information is also consistent with the “true” MVPF falling above \\(\\lambda\\). That is, roughly half of the points are shaded gold (i.e., the policy does not pass our defined societal cost-benefit test) and half are shaded black (i.e., MVPF\\(&lt;\\lambda\\)). If the true MVPF is below \\(\\lambda\\), then society would incur a net welfare loss from implementing the policy.\nContrast this with the scenario in Figure 1 (c), which is based on \\(\\lambda = 0.5\\). In that scenario, there is uncertainty in the underlying welfare estimates but no uncertainty in policy adoption decisions. The same decision (to implement the in-kind benefit program) occurs across the entire uncertainty range, so there is no opportunity cost to making the “wrong” decision."

To answer this question, we can assess whether current knowledge–cast against a summary measure of social preferences such as \\(\\lambda\\)—is sufficient to confidently make policy decisions. Because we may not want to make a stance on the particular value of \\(\\lambda\\), we can vary these assessments over a plausible range of values and estimate the expected welfare loss of making the wrong decision at a given value of \\(\\lambda\\).\nShould we invest more resources to reduce uncertainty in our decisions?

That is, we draw sets of parameters \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{(1)},\\ldots,\\boldsymbol{\\pi}^{(K)}\\) and generate a \\(K\\)-sized vector of net welfare benefits for a given \\(\\lambda\\) value.\nThe code below samples the constituent pieces for the MVPF and NWB for \\(\\lambda=0.88\\):\n\nset.seed(23)\nK &lt;- 1e5\nlambda = 0.88\nw_inkind = rlnorm(K, log(1.2),0.1)\nfe_inkind = rnorm(K, 0.35,.02)\nc_inkind = 1+fe_inkind\nnwb_inkind = w_inkind - lambda * c_inkind\n\n\n\n\n\nAt \\(\\lambda = 0.88\\) the in-kind benefit passes the societal cost-benefit test, so implementation of the in-kind benefit (as compared with doing nothing) is the optimal strategy based on current information. Therefore, the second term in Equation 3 (i.e., \\(E_{\\boldsymbol{\\pi}}[NWB(\\alpha^*,\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\lambda)]\\)) is simply the average NWB of the in-kind benefit:\n\nevppi_2 &lt;- pmax(0,mean(nwb_inkind))\nevppi_2\n\n[1] 0.01831933\n\n\nEstimation of the conditional expectation in the first term in equation Equation 3 is less straightforward. Borrowing from the approach in Strong, Oakley, and Brennan (2014), we can express the NWB outcome as the sum of a conditional expectation plus a mean-zero error term:\n\\[\nNWB(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\\boldsymbol{\\pi^{(k)}},\\lambda)  =  E_{\\boldsymbol{\\pi_{-z}}|\\boldsymbol{\\pi_z}=\\boldsymbol{\\pi_z}^{(k)}}NWB(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_z^{(k)},\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_{-z},\\lambda)  + \\epsilon^{(k)}\n\\tag{4}\\]\nIn addition, the expectation in equation Equation 4 can be thought of in terms of an unknown function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) of \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi_z}\\):\n\\[\nNWB(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\\boldsymbol{\\pi^{(k)}},\\lambda)  = g(\\boldsymbol{\\alpha},\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_z^{(k)},\\lambda) + \\epsilon^{(k)}\n\\tag{5}\\]\nBased on equation Equation 5, one option is to estimate the conditional expectation using a “metamodel,” or a regression model predicting how the net welfare benefit for a particular policy varies with unknown parameters of interest \\(\\boldsymbol{\\pi}_z\\). For example, a metamodel might specify the function \\(g(\\cdot)\\) as a standard linear regression. Alternatively, we might not wish to impose a functional form and instead estimate \\(g(\\cdot)\\) nonparametrically.33 If we suspect the underlying relationships have important nonlinearities in the parameters of interest, we could also appeal to machine learning methods to estimate \\(g(\\cdot)\\).\nThe code below estimates basic metamodels separately for welfare benefits and costs using a generalized additive model:44 In our running example, we have a scalar value for welfare benefits and costs, so the metamodels end up being quite simple in structure. In principle, however, multiple parameters might inform the overall welfare cost or benefit values—in which case we could think of estimating metamodels separately for each, or combine them all into a single metamodel with interaction terms, etc. to capture dependencies or nonlinearities among them in determining the overall welfare benefit or cost value.\n\n# Metamodel for welfare benefits\ngam.w &lt;- gam(nwb_inkind ~ w_inkind)\n\n# Metamodel for welfare costs\ngam.c &lt;- gam(nwb_inkind ~ c_inkind)\n\nBecause we are comparing the in-kind benefit policy to doing nothing (i.e., a policy with zero-valued welfare costs and benefits), the inner (square bracketed) term of the first term in Equation 3 can be estimated by taking the maximum of 0 and the predicted values from the metamodels:\n\nevppi_w_inner &lt;-pmax(0,gam.w$fitted)\nevppi_c_inner &lt;-pmax(0,gam.c$fitted)\n\nThe outer expectation of the first term in Equation 3 is estimated using the average across the \\(K\\) probabilistic draws:\n\nevppi_w_1 = mean(evppi_w_inner)\nevppi_c_1 = mean(evppi_c_inner)\n\nAnd finally, the EVPPI for welfare costs and benefits is estimated by the difference:\n\nevppi_w = evppi_w_1 - evppi_2\nevppi_c = evppi_c_1 - evppi_2\n\nc(\"EVPPI_W\" = evppi_w, \n  \"EVPPI_C\" = evppi_c)\n\n    EVPPI_W     EVPPI_C \n0.038941735 0.001417349 \n\n\nFrom these estimates of the EVPPI we would conclude that the component of \\(\\mathbf{\\pi}\\) with the highest information value is \\(W(\\boldsymbol{\\pi},\\alpha)\\)."

The cumulative distribution function (CDF) of \\(X\\) is the probability that \\(X\\) takes on some value less than \\(x\\):\n\\[\n\\begin{eqnarray}\nF_X(s) = P(X \\leq x)\n\\end{eqnarray}\n\\tag{1}\\]\nThe probability density function (PDF) tells us about the relative likelihood that \\(X\\) takes on any given value, and can be defined as the derivative of the CDF:\n\\[\nf_X(x) = \\frac{dF_X(x)}{dx}\n\\tag{2}\\]\nWorking in the opposite direction, we can also define the CDF by integrating the PDF:\n\\[\nF_X(x)=\\int_{-\\infty}^x f_X(t) d t\n\\tag{3}\\]\nThis relationship is helpful because it allows us to define the expected value of \\(X\\) as a weighted sum of values \\(x\\), with weights defined by the PDF. In integral notation:\n\\[\n\\mathrm{E_X}[X]=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} x f_X(x) dx\n\\tag{4}\\]\n\n\nOur example data will be taken from the Oregon Health Insurance Experiment (OHIE).

    "text": "Do It “By Hand” Using Regression\nIn the example below, we’ll construct a CDF “by hand” by defining our various values of \\(t\\) (which we’ll call y_), and then looping over them. Within each loop, we first define a binary outcome, with values of one if the value of \\(Y\\) is less than or equal to the given y_ value under consideration, and zero otherwise. We next regress this binary outcome on an intercept only; the resulting coefficient on the intercept term provides an estimate of the fraction of the sample with a \\(Y\\) value less than or equal to the y_ value.\nWe repeat this for all y_ values and plot the result as a yellow line on top of the previous plot:\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical CDF\n\n\n\n\nAs the figure shows, we have successfully replicated the empirical CDF plot produced by ecdf()."

We then need to predict the outcome response to obtain an estimate of the fraction of the sample with value less than or equal to the given y_ value (this is analogous to obtaining the coefficient on the intercept term in the linear probability model approach above).\nOur new eCDF values are plotted in red below.

    "text": "Create A “Smoothed” Version Using a Shape-Constrained Generalized Additive Model\nRecall from above that to calculate the PDF of \\(X\\) we can differentiate the CDF (Equation 2). However, the eCDFs calculated above are “chunky”—they are essentially step functions that move at discrete values defined over the support of the outcome.\nDepending on the application we may want to fit a smoothed function to these step function values. While R provides functionality to fit a smoothed curve to a given set of points (approxfun()), the resulting approximation function will likely not play by the rules of a CDF (e.g., minimum value 0, maximum value 1, monotonically increasing throughout, etc.).\nTo fit this approximation function we can fit a shape constrained additive model that imposes these constraints. In the plot below, this new smoothed eCDF curve is plotted in green over the step function plotted above.\n\n\nThis approach is based on the paper here and the code here.\n\n\n\n\n\nEmpirical CDF based on Shape Constrained Additive Model"
